The 147 morphs were given by Dr. Manassi and the masks for them (which are in the same zip file) are generated using maskgenerator.m

To-Do:
 - [ ] Fix click
 - [ ] Add introduction page with instructions
 - [ ] Get user input in console in the beginning
 - [ ] Implement data saving
 - [ ] Figure out wtf we were supposed to do with the 4 different matrix thingies
 - [ ] Test
