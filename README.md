# Serial Dependence and Its Effect on Radiology Diagnoses
Developed and authored by Johnson, Cole; Nakhkoob, Sina; Pu, Kyle; Zhang, Jinyang

4 different experiments each testing a different element of serial dependence in radiology: tumor classification, tumor detection, tumor localization, and tumor search times.

Our results suggest that tumor classification is most heavily biased by perceptual serial dependence. Further research is needed, however, to determine what causes the inaccuracy biases in the tumor localization task (whether it be perceptual visual serial dependence or motor serial dependence).
